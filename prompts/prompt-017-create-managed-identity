Create a user assigned managed identity called mid-AppModAssist-[Day-Hour-Minute] (replacing [Day-Hour-Minute] with actual day, month, minute)
and assign it to this app service so it can later connect to Azure SQL with this identity.

bear in mind that when using a user-assigned managed identity, the principalId property is not directly on the identity object so avoid trying output it. 

Place the Bicep file in `deploy-infra/modules/managed-identity.bicep` and ensure it can be called as a module from `deploy-infra/main.bicep`

This is INFRASTRUCTURE deployment - the managed identity must be created before the App Service and SQL can reference it.
